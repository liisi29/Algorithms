I took the solution from internet. It got 100%
But I keep reading the exercise and I understand that 
The product of triplet (P, Q, R) equates to 
A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] (0 â‰¤ P < Q < R < N).
For example, array A such that:

  A[0] = -3
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 2
  A[3] = -2
  A[4] = 5
  A[5] = 6

  .. means that I cannot mix up the original order of elements.
  So for [9,7,8,1,2,3]
  the correct answer according to my understanding would be 1*2*3
  But according this 100% solution its: 9*7*8
